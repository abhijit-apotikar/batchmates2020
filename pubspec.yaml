# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning

flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/abhi_green_dp.jpg
    - assets/images/sbman.png
    - assets/images/woman.png
    - assets/images/google_logo.png
    - assets/images/e_mail.png
    - assets/images/person.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Nunito
      fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-Bold.ttf
        weight: 700
      - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-Italic.ttf
        style: italic
      - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-Regular.ttf
    - family: Pica
      fonts:
      - asset: assets\fonts\IMFellDoublePica-Italic.ttf
        style: italic
      - asset: assets\fonts\IMFellDoublePica-Regular.ttf
    - family: Satisfy
      fonts:
      - asset: assets\fonts\Satisfy-Regular.ttf
    - family: Typewriter
      fonts:
      - asset: assets\fonts\SpecialElite-Regular.ttf
  #   - family: Trajan Pro

  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
